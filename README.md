# graphiso
This is a quick implementation of the weighted matching eigendecomposition solution proposed originally by Umeyama in 1988.

The implementation is in pure golang using the gonum package.

The test examples should be self explanatory and the data provided are the same data sets in th original paper.

In order to solve the bipartite maximum weighted matching problem a pure golang version of lsa is provided.
